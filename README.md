# QEcurves
This is a repository for the complilation of QE curves as of 28 July 2017. We collect here all the QE source information for the proposed  update to the throughput estimate, along with the machine-readable text file for each type of sensor. The jupyter notebook documents how the curves were obtained. There is also a python script run at SLAC to find all the QE curves available from TS3 at BNL.
